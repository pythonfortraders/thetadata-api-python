# thetadata-api-python

This is a simple Python wrapper for thetadata API.

* ThetaData offers a [thetadata-python](https://github.com/ThetaData-API/thetadata-python) library, but it is deprecated and it's preferred to use the REST API directly. 
* Their documentation provides Python examples for the REST API that are useful and comprehensive. 
* This library is just a simple wrapper on those into neat classes and functions that anyone can download and use. It's not meant to be novel or official, just a convenience.
