# thetadata-api-python

This is a simple, easy-to-use, unofficial Python wrapper for the thetadata API.

Context: 
* ThetaData offers a [thetadata-python](https://github.com/ThetaData-API/thetadata-python) library, but it is deprecated and it's preferred to use the REST API directly. 
* Their documentation provides Python examples for the REST API that are useful and comprehensive. You'll find these on every endpoint page ([example](https://http-docs.thetadata.us/docs/theta-data-rest-api-v2/a38vp739baoch-quote-snapshot)).
* This library is just a simple wrapper on those into neat classes and functions that anyone can download and use. One benefit is easy integration with pandas, so you may get data directly into a DataFrame. However, this library as a whole isn't meant to be novel or official, just a convenience.
